      <p>Brazil</p> 

      <p>Let's start with some curiosities about Brazil.</p>

Brazil is the only country in America that speaks Portuguese. It is a multicultural country due to the immigration of people from different parts of the world; it also has a variety of wildlife, ecosystems and habitats mainly because the Amazon is mostly in its territory.
There are two states in Brazil where the rivers meet, at a certain point the Rio Negro and the Amazon meet in the state of Amazonas, in the state of Piauí the rivers Poti and Parnaíba meet. Opal is also found in Piauí, a precious stone where its most important reserves are in Piauí and Australia. In the country there are a variety of religions, religious freedom is present in the constitution. And it is the country with the biggest carnival in the world.
Music in Brazil was formed mainly with the fusion of European and African elements. Sport is also very present in Brazilian culture.
<p>Brazil has many curiosities but for now we are just going to talk about its typical foods and its tourist attractions.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Typical Foods</h3>
      <p>
        Brazil has a variety of typical foods, each state has a variety of foods and these states are divided into regions, so only one food from each region that all states in that region have in common will be addressed.
        <p>Northeast Region</p>

        Baião de Dois:
        It is a dish made of rice, beans, dried meat and curd cheese. There are those who say that the origin of the name is due to the typical northeastern dance, the baião.
        Baião, as it is a mixture of two popular and easily accessible elements of Brazilian cuisine, rice and beans, is very common in rural areas.
      
        <p>North Region</p>

        Tacacá:
        It is of indigenous origin.
        Prepared with a yellowish broth called tucupi. This broth is poured over the manioc gum, also served with jambu (an Amazonian herb that causes numbness in the mouth) and dried shrimp. It is served very hot, seasoned with pepper, in gourds.
      
        <p>South Region</p>

        Chimia:
        are different types of food that can be spread on bread.
        Schmier can also mean a slice of bread already spread with any food, whether with Schmier/sweet, jam, honey, butter, margarine, cream, pâté. It can be made in a variety of flavors using peels, fruits, or other combinations.
      
       <p>Midwest Region</p>

       Chicken with Pequi:
       chicken with pequi is one of those typical dishes in which the fruit brings out its striking flavor and color. In traditional chicken dishes, free-range chicken is fundamental and must be sautéed to bring even more flavor and then eaten with seasonings. The pequi must be cooked separately.
      
       <p>Southeast Region</p>

       Cheese bread:
       it is a small baked cheese roll or cheese bread, a popular snack and breakfast, it is also very common in grocery stores, supermarkets and bakeries, industrialized or freshly made. Despite being called “bread”, cheese bread is basically a type of flour or sweet biscuit with eggs, salt, vegetable oil and cheese, with a soft and elastic consistency and with some variations.
      <p>An honorable mention has to be made of the Brigadeiro, a sweet dessert. It is made of condensed milk, cocoa powder, butter, and chocolate sprinkles covering the outside layer.
It is a popular confection throughout the country, especially for festive events. Brigadeiros are commonly made at home, and also found in bakeries and snack shops.</p>

      <h3>Tourist Spots</h3>
      <p>
        Just like the other page, only one tourist spot in each region will be mentioned due to the wide variety of tourist spots in the country.
      
      <p>Northeast Region</p>

Lençóis Maranhenses:

Inserted in the marine coastal biome, the park is an exponent of the mangrove, restinga and dune ecosystems, associating strong winds and regular rains. Its great scenic beauty, combined with walks through the dune fields and the possibility of bathing in the lakes, attract tourists from all over the world, who visit the park throughout the year.
      <p>North Region</p>

Jalapan:

In addition to the large aquatic web, there are already several tourist attractions and curiosities, such as the "fervedouros", which are water mines that gush water with enough force so that a person does not sink inside. Another very interesting tourist spot in the region are the Dunes, a much visited point and where many people come to admire the sunset.
    <p>South Region</p> 

Iguaçu Falls:
are waterfalls on the Iguaçu River on the border of the Argentine province of Misiones and the Brazilian state of Paraná. Together they form the largest waterfall system in the world. The falls divide the river into upper and lower Iguaçu. The Iguaçu river rises near the heart of the city of Curitiba. For most of its course, the river crosses Brazil.
<p>Midwest Region</p>

Chapada dos Veadeiros:
 Among the park's main attractions are the two falls of the Preto river, the Preto river canyons, waterfalls on rocky walls at a narrowing of the river, and the Carioquinhas waterfalls, a formation of natural pools ideal for light baths and hydromassage.
<p>Southeast Region</p>

Christ the Redeemer:

Symbol of Christianity, Christ the Redeemer has also become a cultural icon of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Latin America as a whole, being portrayed in cinema, television and songs. The monument is an important tourist spot, and is one of the seven wonders of the world.
