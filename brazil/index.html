            <h2>Let's start with some curiosities about Brazil.</h2>
            <p>Brazil is the only country in America that speaks Portuguese. It is a multicultural country due to the immigration of people from different parts of the world; it also has a variety of wildlife, ecosystems and habitats mainly because the Amazon is mostly in its territory. There are two states in Brazil where the rivers meet, at a certain point the Rio Negro and the Amazon meet in the state of Amazonas, in the state of Piauí the rivers Poti and Parnaíba meet. Opal is also found in Piauí, a precious stone where its most important reserves are in Piauí and Australia. In the country there are a variety of religions, religious freedom is present in the constitution. And it is the country with the biggest carnival in the world. Music in Brazil was formed mainly with the fusion of European and African elements. 
                Sport is also very present in Brazilian culture.</p>
            <p>Brazil has many curiosities but for now we are just going to talk about its typical foods and its tourist attractions.</p>
